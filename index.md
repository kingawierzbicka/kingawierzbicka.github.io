Welcome to my art gallery. My work is rooted in the timeless mediums of oil paints, oil pastels, charcoal, and ink. Through these classic tools, I explore the unique textures and spontaneity that allow me to convey profound emotion and depth in every piece. Whether painting en plein air or working with live models in the studio, I strive to capture the moment in every stroke. Thank you for visiting and exploring my world of art.
